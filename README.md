# DPScript

DPScript is a transpiled programming language to aid in Datapack development, inspired by CBScript.

# Features

- Extremely comfortable syntax
- A friendly and familiar syntax
- An IR form to allow other syntaxes to grow on top of DPScript's framework
- Advanced conditionals
- Scoreboard & store manipulation
- A batteries-included standard library (WIP)
- Full array support
- Support for loops
- Compile-time constants
- Easy text components and NBT manipulation
- Functions & subroutines
- Tags
- Init & Tick blocks
- Modules
- Imports & Exports
- A language server for auto-completion (Coming Soon!)
- Support for your favorite IDEs (WIP)
- A fully-fledged package registry and build system (Coming Soon!)
- And much more!

DPScript features a fully custom tokenizer, lexer, validator, and AST to provide an extremely comfortable
syntax while being very stable. By merging all imported files into a single AST it can provide the best
error detection and validation possible. Don't worry anymore about strange issues when making datapacks!
